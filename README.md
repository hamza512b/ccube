# Rotating Cube in terminal
I have made this rotating cube from scratch, too learn more about C. I have always been facsinated by 3d computer graphics, which I usually do in Webgl and JavaScript. But since I am learning C, I tried to do this.

# To run yourself
Make sure you have make and some c compiler and simple run: 
```
make
```

and then run executable with the width of charachters as argument.
```
./build/draw_cube 50
```
